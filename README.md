Setting:
* The Dark Ages
* Magic is Alive
	* Man uses willpower from within himself
	* Man uses natural energy from the world around him

* Awakening is generally due to:
	* a great amount of change, or complete lack thereof

	* an intense event
		* friends/family dying
		* fighting/fleeing for your life

	* great stillness/peace/emptyness
		* deep meditation
		* a person may see there family killed, and remain unawakened.
			* they leave, live as a shell, empty of thought, meditating on a mountain.
			* they become one with the world

* Awakening burns a 'commitment' into those awakened
	* this can be thought of as their main goal, passion, or purpose in life
	* it can drive a person to be a hero or a villan
		* or give them the ability to forcefully remain on the sides of civilization
		
    Not all those who are awakened are enlightened.
    
    A robber stealing to feed his family is righteous of purpose.

		A robber awakened when fleeing the guards could equally be burned with, 
			a noble passion to help and protect the poor
			or a burning wish for vengence against the town that has forsaken his family.

		Each man and his circumstances are unique.
		Partial products of the world around them.

		In a world with so much violence.
		We truly reap what we sew.

* The Church:
	* All magic is an invocation of sacred power
	* Only church trained are allowed to use it
		* Rumors of twisted initiation ceremonies and commitments to the estabilishment sound anything but 'holy'
	* Others will be hunted, with an awakened zeal

* Champions/Villans/Hermits:
	* Those initiated through great change/hardship
		* seeing your parents killed
		* fighting for your life
		* fleeing for your life
	* or through great stillness, peace, and openess
		* hermit meditating in a cave
		* prisoner accepting of his fate
	* upon awakening can be:
		* pushed into becoming Champions of the people
		* a Villan, against the people
		* a Hermit, vigorously desiring to stay outside of society, left alone
		

Combat

### Attacks/Defenses:

	* supplement them with focus-pool additions

### Willpower:
* You only have so much willpower to aid you in combat, use it wisely

### Natural Energy
* The world around you is like a small battery you can tap
* If you capture key energy flows on the battle field you will gain a distinct advantage

* Your movement, and that of your squad, is a combat meta game crucial to winning
