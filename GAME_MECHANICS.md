* There is also an initiative order
* Turns can be Fully TurnBased or Semi-Real Time (3-10 seconds per action)

### Attacks/Defenses:
* make sure to work with your squad to make efficient maneuvers against opponents
* separate a focus-pool between 'attack', 'defense', 'counter'

* allocate willpower and energy pts to special attacks
	* supplement them with focus-pool additions

### Willpower:
* You only have so much willpower to aid you in combat, use it wisely

### Natural Energy
* The world around you is like a small battery you can tap
* If you capture key energy flows on the battle field you will gain a distinct advantage
* If your opponent does you will be at a distinct disadvantage.
* Your movement, and that of your squad, is a combat meta game crucial to winning
