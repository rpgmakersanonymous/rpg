This game is meant to be played like old NES games, with **friends sitting around a tv**

#### Art and Style
Based on our use of crafty.js, KISS, and [available artwork](http://opengameart.org/), this game will be an 2d overhead map similar in style to the old Zelda games, or Pokemon Gameboy games, with a medival theme.

#### Main Display(s)
A player will open a game session on their tv through a connected computer or other device capable of html5 to the tv.  This screen will serve as the overhead view for all the players in the session.

The Main Display will essentially consist of a 2d overhead map of the players, enemies, and the environment.
Animation is an eventual goal.

#### Controller(s)
This game is expected to be controlled by a touch screen.  Either a players smartphone, tablet, or laptop will do.
While not everyone can play this, many walk around with this hard ware now, and browser enabled tvs are becoming more common.

The controller view will be optimized for mobile touch screens, and secondarily for laptop control.

* Multiple player controllers will be able to login simultaneously to a single game session.
* Multiple players can play on one Main Display.
* Multiple Main Displays can be connected to one session to allow remote players.

## Turn-based/Restful Gameplay
* Play will progress at the pace of players taking actions.(goal)
* Play can eventually be real-time/automated or given time constraints.(non-goal)

## Macro/Micro Map
* players explore a macro map
* encounters occur within a micro map

## movement

## actions

## girlfriend mode
* the point is to let friends play together
* if one person has played 50 hours
	* and another is a noob
	* why cant they play together?
* simple characters can be generated on the fly
	* with level normalization applied
	```They can hit hard, but lack the powerful techniques developed by a true warrior```
